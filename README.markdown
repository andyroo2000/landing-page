# Landing Page

## What is this?

This is just a simple landing page I made, which redirects people to my various websites and social media profiles.

I thought about using About.me or various other services for the same thing, but I couldn't resist rolling my own.

## What's the deal with the file structure?

I put the jade template in the 'pages' folder and the stylus stylesheet in the 'styles' folder.

I'm using CodeKit to compile all of these inside the 'public' folder.

Nothing fancy for hosting, just FTP to my cheap shared host (*like it's 1999*)

## What's missing?

Unfortunately, Font-Awesome doesn't have an icon for SoundCloud, so I'm going to have to find a useable svg or other icon for that at some point.

## Why share this?

Judging by the number of services that offer personal landing pages, there is a pretty good demand for them.

And why not have a simple lightweight starter template for a personal landing page? Just swap out the photo and adjust the links as necessary and boom!
